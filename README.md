# Cloud-Connected Restaurant Lighting Backend (CSE Senior Design, Budderfly)

This project implements the backend system for an IoT-enabled restaurant lighting control solution, as part of a joint ECE/CSE senior design project with Budderfly. The focus is on demonstrating cloud integration, remote state management, and scalable backend software architecture for responsive lighting control.

## Overview

The backend provides API endpoints, MQTT integration, and state management for simulated restaurant lighting across multiple locations. Users interact through a web-based UI, with commands routed to the cloud and handled in real time.

## Project Goals

- Establish secure one-way MQTT connection between Python backend and AWS IoT Core
- Enable the backend to publish control commands to cloud-based devices (ESP32s)
- Simulate and store lighting states for multiple restaurant zones in a mock database
- Provide a robust codebase for rapid prototyping, future expansion, and team collaboration

## Technologies

- AWS IoT Core (MQTT Broker for device communication)
- Python (Flask / FastAPI) for backend REST API and MQTT publishing
- paho-mqtt for Python-based MQTT connectivity
- SQLite or PostgreSQL (mock database for lighting state)
- Git for code management and collaboration

## Key Files

- **main.py:** Main backend service
- **.gitignore:** Excludes sensitive files and local environments (see below)
- **requirements.txt:** Python dependencies (e.g., paho-mqtt, Flask)
- **README.md:** Project documentation

## Security

- Certificates/keys are never committed; always handled via .gitignore
- Environment variables (.env) recommended for AWS credentials and configuration

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a Python virtual environment (`python3 -m venv venv`).
3. Install dependencies from requirements.txt.
4. Ensure the following files are present (but NOT tracked by Git):
   - AWS IoT certificate, private key, and CA (see .gitignore).
5. Configure connection parameters in main.py or via environment variables.
6. Launch backend service and test cloud connection (see usage in code comments).
